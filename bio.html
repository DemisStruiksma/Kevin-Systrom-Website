        <p>Kevin Systrom is an American entrepreneur best known as the co-founder and chief <br> executive of Instagram, the photo-sharing, social network application that even the <br> most social media allergic in the fashion industry are addicted
          to.<br><br>
          From first-mover mega-brands like Burberry and pioneering image-makers like Nick Knight , to <br> models-of-the-moment Cara Delevingne and fast-scaling retailers like Nasty Gal , Instagram <br> has taken off significantly in the fashion
          industry. “I think that Instagram as a visual <br> platform just fits very naturally with how the fashion community communicates its work,” <br> Systrom explained to BoF.<br><br> The app has proved to be a powerful marketing tool for
          brands, providing relatable content, show <br> coverage and extensive brand exposure. Instagram was awarded the CFDA Eugenia <br> Sheppard Award in 2015. Its mobile platform also makes it highly convenient for on-the-go <br> fashion
          professionals, enabling them to attend and share events with their virtual followers in <br> tow.<br><br>
          The rise of Instagram has even changed the way in which fashion shows are documented, <br> influencing the collections themselves. “The way that we shoot it, the way that we showcase it and <br> the way that we make the clothes and design
          them changed.” Alexander Wang told The New <br> York Times, discussing Instagram’s impact on the industry.
          <br><br>Systrom was introduced to computer programming whilst attending school in Concord, <br> Massachusetts, having played computer games as a child. He graduated in 2006 from Stanford <br> University, and during his degree he was chosen
          to participate in the highly prestigious <br> Mayfield Fellows Programme. This led to an internship at Odea, the company that gave rise <br> to Twitter.
          <br><br>After stints at Google and Nextstop (a location recommendation start-up) Systrom created Burbn <br> with the intention to combine location check-ins and social games. After pitching the idea at <br> a party he received $500,000
          seed funding within 2 weeks. The creation of Burbn led to <br> Instagram. A month after launching, Instagram had grown to 1 million users, and within 18 <br> months it had gone from nascent start-up to a $1 billion acquisition by Facebook.
